# Repository: Mapping Custom GPT Platforms

The purpose of this repository is to gather together a list of platforms, technologies, and tools for creating custom GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers).

A definition for a `custom GPT` solicited from ChatGPT that I like is:

`A custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) refers to a tailored language model based on an existing GPT architecture, like GPT-4, that has been adapted or fine-tuned for specific tasks, industries, or applications. `

## What Are Custom GPT Platforms?

"Custom GPT platforms" is not a perfect descriptor but rather referes to a growing array of tools supporting two interrelated use-cases:

- 1: **Creating highly-specialised GPTs for specific applications**. Typically, these are developed by businesses although there is nothing stopping private individuals from creating highly tailored GPTs to support their personal uses.
- 2: **Creating "fleets" of custom GPTs with the intention of covering a wide variety of use-cases with multiple GPTs or "chaining" together custom GPTs as a form of process automation** (e.g. GPT 1 parses output to GPT 2 which sends a final output to the business user).

## Synonyms And Closely Related Terms

GPTs and GPT applications are both evolving rapidly.

The manner in which companies describe their tools for marketing purposes can reflect both stylistic preferences as well as slight differences in functionality that are not reflective of major technological differences.

For that reason, and for the purpose of this repository, the following terms are considered to be highly correlated with "custom GPTs"

- GPT fleets
-  Custom AI bots
-  AI workforces
-  AI fleets
  
Etc, etc.
